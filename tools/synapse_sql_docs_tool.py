Select all rows where column foo has a value with a prefix of 'bar'. In this example the right-hand-side of the LIKE keyword is a regular expression where the '%' represents one or more characters or even zero characters.

Select all rows where column foo has a value with a prefix of 'bar'. In this example the right-hand-side of the LIKE keyword is a regular expression where the '_' represents one and only one character.

The default escape character for LIKE regular expression is the '\\' character. In this example we want to find all rows such that foo that contain 'bar_' so we will need to escape the '_' character.
select * from syn123 where foo like 'bar\\_'

To use a different escape character for LIKE regular expression we must define the escape character. In this example, the '|' will be used as an escape character instead of '\\'.
select * from syn123 where foo like 'bar|_' escape '|'

Select all rows where column foo has a value equal to one or column bar has a value equals to two.
