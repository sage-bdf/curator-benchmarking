The user wants me to convert the input text to uppercase and return it as JSON with the structure { \"uppercase\": \"CONVERTED TEXT\" }. The input text given is \"hello world\".\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. The input data is a JSON object with a \"text\" field. The value there is \"hello world\". My task is to take that text, convert it to all uppercase letters, so it becomes \"HELLO WORLD\".\n\nThen, I have to structure the output as a JSON object with the key \"uppercase\" and the value being the converted text. So the final JSON should look like { \"uppercase\": \"HELLO WORLD\" }.\n\nI need to make sure that the JSON is correctly formatted. No extra spaces, proper quotation marks, and the key matches exactly as specified. Also, check that the conversion to uppercase is accurate. Let me confirm: \"hello world\" in uppercase is indeed \"HELLO WORLD\". \n\nNo other processing is needed here. The input is straightforward, and the output structure is clearly defined. I don't see any edge cases here since there are no special characters or numbers in the input text. Just a simple lowercase string. \n\nSo, the steps are: read the input text, convert to uppercase, wrap it in the specified JSON structure. That's it. Should be a simple task.
