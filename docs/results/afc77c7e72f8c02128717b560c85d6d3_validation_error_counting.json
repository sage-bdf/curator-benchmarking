The input data is given as a JSON object with a 'grid_data' string that contains another JSON structure.\n\nFirst, I should parse the 'grid_data' string into a JSON object. The 'grid_data' has a 'rows' array, and each row is an object with 'id' and 'valid' properties. My task is to iterate through each row in the 'rows' array and check if 'valid' is false. For each row where 'valid' is false, I increment the count.\n\nLet me make sure I understand the structure correctly. The input data is a JSON object with two keys: 'grid_data' and 'question'. The 'grid_data' is a string that represents another JSON object. So I need to parse that string first. Once parsed, the 'rows' array inside it will be accessible.\n\nSo steps:\n1. Parse the input JSON to get the 'grid_data' string.\n2. Parse the 'grid_data' string into a JSON object.\n3. Access the 'rows' array from the parsed grid_data.\n4. Iterate over each row in the rows array.\n5. For each row, check if 'valid' is false.\n6. Count how many times this condition is true.\n7. Return the count in the specified JSON format.\n\nWait, the input data is provided as a JSON object where 'grid_data' is a string. So in the example given, the grid_data is a string that contains the actual JSON structure. So first, I need to parse that string into a JSON object to access the rows.\n\nLet me test this with the example input. The grid_data string is:\n\n\"{\\\"rows\\\": [{\\\"id\\\": 1, \\\"valid\\\": true}, {\\\"id\\\": 2, \\\"valid\\\": false}, {\\\"id\\\": 3, \\\"valid\\\": false}, {\\\"id\\\": 4, \\\"valid\\\": true}, {\\\"id\\\": 5, \\\"valid\\\": false}]}\"\n\nWhen parsed, this becomes an object with a 'rows' array. The rows are 5 in total. Looking at each 'valid' value:\n\nRow 1: true \u2192 no error.\nRow 2: false \u2192 error. Count 1.\nRow 3: false \u2192 error. Count 2.\nRow 4: true \u2192 no error.\nRow 5: false \u2192 error. Count 3.\n\nSo the total count should be 3. The answer should be {\"count\": 3}.\n\nI need to make sure that the code correctly parses the nested JSON. Also, handle any possible parsing errors, but assuming the input is well-formed as per the problem statement.\n\nAnother thing to note: the 'valid' field is a boolean, so checking for false strictly. Not considering cases where it might be a string \"false\" or other falsy values. So in the code, the check is row['valid'] === false.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward. Iterate through each row, count the number where valid is false. Then return the count in the specified JSON structure.\n",

                        "text": "Okay, let's see. I need to count the number of rows in the grid data where the 'valid' field is false. The input data is given as a JSON object with a 'grid_data' string that contains another JSON structure.\n\nFirst, I should parse the 'grid_data' string into a JSON object. The 'grid_data' has a 'rows' array, and each row is an object with 'id' and 'valid' properties. My task is to iterate through each row in the 'rows' array and check if 'valid' is false. For each row where 'valid' is false, I increment the count.\n\nLet me make sure I understand the structure correctly. The input data is a JSON object with two keys: 'grid_data' and 'question'. The 'grid_data' is a string that represents another JSON object. So I need to parse that string first. Once parsed, the 'rows' array inside it will be accessible.\n\nSo steps:\n1. Parse the input JSON to get the 'grid_data' string.\n2. Parse the 'grid_data' string into a JSON object.\n3. Access the 'rows' array from the parsed grid_data.\n4. Iterate over each row in the rows array.\n5. For each row, check if 'valid' is false.\n6. Count how many times this condition is true.\n7. Return the count in the specified JSON format.\n\nWait, the input data is provided as a JSON object where 'grid_data' is a string. So in the example given, the grid_data is a string that contains the actual JSON structure. So first, I need to parse that string into a JSON object to access the rows.\n\nLet me test this with the example input. The grid_data string is:\n\n\"{\\\"rows\\\": [{\\\"id\\\": 1, \\\"valid\\\": true}, {\\\"id\\\": 2, \\\"valid\\\": false}, {\\\"id\\\": 3, \\\"valid\\\": false}, {\\\"id\\\": 4, \\\"valid\\\": true}, {\\\"id\\\": 5, \\\"valid\\\": false}]}\"\n\nWhen parsed, this becomes an object with a 'rows' array. The rows are 5 in total. Looking at each 'valid' value:\n\nRow 1: true \u2192 no error.\nRow 2: false \u2192 error. Count 1.\nRow 3: false \u2192 error. Count 2.\nRow 4: true \u2192 no error.\nRow 5: false \u2192 error. Count 3.\n\nSo the total count should be 3. The answer should be {\"count\": 3}.\n\nI need to make sure that the code correctly parses the nested JSON. Also, handle any possible parsing errors, but assuming the input is well-formed as per the problem statement.\n\nAnother thing to note: the 'valid' field is a boolean, so checking for false strictly. Not considering cases where it might be a string \"false\" or other falsy values. So in the code, the check is row['valid'] === false.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward. Iterate through each row, count the number where valid is false. Then return the count in the specified JSON structure.\n"

The input data is given as a JSON object with a \"grid_data\" key, which itself is a string containing another JSON object. So first, I need to parse the grid_data string into a JSON object.\n\nOnce parsed, the grid_data has a \"rows\" array. Each element in this array is a row object with an \"id\" and a \"valid\" boolean. My task is to iterate through each row in the rows array and check if the \"valid\" property is false. For each row where it's false, I increment a counter.\n\nLet me break it down step by step. First, parse the grid_data string. The input is:\n\n{\n  \"grid_data\": \"{\\\"rows\\\": [{\\\"id\\\": 1, \\\"valid\\\": true}, {\\\"id\\\": 2, \\\"valid\\\": false}, {\\\"id\\\": 3, \\\"valid\\\": true}, {\\\"id\\\": 4, \\\"valid\\\": false}, {\\\"id\\\": 5, \\\"valid\\\": false}, {\\\"id\\\": 6, \\\"valid\\\": true}, {\\\"id\\\": 7, \\\"valid\\\": false}]}\",\n  \"question\": \"How many rows have a validation error?\"\n}\n\nSo the grid_data is a string that represents a JSON object. I need to parse that string into an actual JSON object. Once parsed, I can access the rows array.\n\nLooking at the rows array, there are 7 elements. Let's list them out:\n\n1. id 1, valid: true\n2. id 2, valid: false\n3. id 3, valid: true\n4. id 4, valid: false\n5. id 5, valid: false\n6. id 6, valid: true\n7. id 7, valid: false\n\nNow, count how many have valid: false. Let's see:\n\nRow 2: false \u2192 count 1\nRow 4: false \u2192 count 2\nRow 5: false \u2192 count 3\nRow 7: false \u2192 count 4\n\nSo total of 4 rows with validation errors.\n\nTherefore, the count should be 4. The final JSON should be {\"count\": 4}.\n\nI need to make sure that the code correctly parses the grid_data string.

The input data is given as a JSON object with a \"grid_data\" key, which itself is a string containing another JSON object. So first, I need to parse the grid_data string into a JSON object.\n\nOnce parsed, the grid_data has a \"rows\" array. Each element in this array is a row object with an \"id\" and a \"valid\" boolean. My task is to iterate through each row in the rows array and check if the \"valid\" property is false. For each row where it's false, I increment a counter.\n\nLet me break it down step by step. First, parse the grid_data string. The input is:\n\n{\n  \"grid_data\": \"{\\\"rows\\\": [{\\\"id\\\": 1, \\\"valid\\\": true}, {\\\"id\\\": 2, \\\"valid\\\": false}, {\\\"id\\\": 3, \\\"valid\\\": true}, {\\\"id\\\": 4, \\\"valid\\\": false}, {\\\"id\\\": 5, \\\"valid\\\": false}, {\\\"id\\\": 6, \\\"valid\\\": true}, {\\\"id\\\": 7, \\\"valid\\\": false}]}\",\n  \"question\": \"How many rows have a validation error?\"\n}\n\nSo the grid_data is a string that represents a JSON object. I need to parse that string into an actual JSON object. Once parsed, I can access the rows array.\n\nLooking at the rows array, there are 7 elements. Let's list them out:\n\n1. id 1, valid: true\n2. id 2, valid: false\n3. id 3, valid: true\n4. id 4, valid: false\n5. id 5, valid: false\n6. id 6, valid: true\n7. id 7, valid: false\n\nNow, count how many have valid: false. Let's see:\n\nRow 2: false \u2192 count 1\nRow 4: false \u2192 count 2\nRow 5: false \u2192 count 3\nRow 7: false \u2192 count 4\n\nSo total of 4 rows with validation errors.\n\nTherefore, the count should be 4.

The input data is a JSON object containing grid_data, which itself is a stringified JSON. So first, I need to parse the grid_data to get the actual rows.\n\nLooking at the grid_data, it's a string that represents a JSON object with a \"rows\" array. Each row has an \"id\" and a \"valid\" boolean. The task is to count how many of these rows have \"valid\": false.\n\nSo the steps are: parse the grid_data string into a JSON object, iterate over each row in the rows array, check if the valid property is false, and increment the count each time it is. Then, return the count in the specified JSON structure.\n\nWait, let me check the example input. The grid_data has 10 rows, all with \"valid\": false. So the count should be 10. That's straightforward. But I need to make sure that I'm correctly parsing the string. The grid_data is given as a string, so I need to parse it twice: first, parse the outer JSON to get the grid_data string, then parse that string into the actual grid data structure.\n\nSo in code terms, it would be like:\n\n1. Parse the input JSON to get grid_data string.\n2. Parse grid_data into a JSON object.\n3. Access the rows array.\n4. Loop through each row, check if valid is false.\n5. Count all such rows.\n\nBut since this is a thought process, I just need to simulate that. Let me confirm that all 10 rows in the example have valid: false. Yes, each of the 10 entries has \"valid\": false. So the count is 10. Therefore, the answer should be {\"count\": 10}.\n"
