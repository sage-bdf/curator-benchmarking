The user provided an input JSON with fields diagnosis, assay, and tumorType. My job is to replace any synonyms or alternative terms with the exact values from the Target Schema.\n\nFirst, looking at the diagnosis: \"neurofibromatosis type 1\". The Target Schema's enum for diagnosis includes \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\" with a capital 'N' and 'type' in lowercase. The input has it all lowercase except 'type 1'. Wait, no, the input is \"neurofibromatosis type 1\" which is lowercase except 'type 1'. The correct enum is \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\" with the first letter capitalized. So I need to adjust the capitalization here. But wait, the schema's enum entries are case-sensitive? The example in the schema shows \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\" with 'Neurofibromatosis' capitalized. So the input's lowercase 'neurofibromatosis' should be corrected to match the schema's exact value. So diagnosis becomes \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\".\n\nNext, the assay is \"WES\". The Target Schema's assay enum includes \"whole exome sequencing\". WES is a common abbreviation for Whole Exome Sequencing. The schema doesn't list \"WES\" as an option, so I need to replace \"WES\" with \"whole exome sequencing\".\n\nFor tumorType, the input is \"MPNST\". The Target Schema's tumorType enum has \"Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor\". MPNST is the acronym for that. Since the schema doesn't include the acronym, the full term is required. So \"MPNST\" should be replaced with \"Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor\".\n\nI need to ensure that all replacements are exact matches from the enums provided.

The user provided an input JSON with three fields: diagnosis, assay, and tumorType. My job is to replace any synonyms in these fields with the exact terms from the Target Schema.\n\nFirst, looking at the diagnosis field: the input is \"ORPHA:636\". ORPHA codes are identifiers from Orphanet, a database for rare diseases. I need to find out what condition this code corresponds to. A quick check tells me that ORPHA:636 is the code for Neurofibromatosis type 1. Checking the Target Schema's diagnosis enum, \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\" is indeed one of the options. So I'll replace \"ORPHA:636\" with \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\".\n\nNext, the assay field has \"WGS\". WGS stands for Whole Genome Sequencing. Looking at the assay enum in the schema, \"whole genome sequencing\" is listed. The case here is lowercase except the first letters, but the schema specifies exact values. Wait, the schema's enum has \"whole genome sequencing\" in lowercase except the first letters? Let me check again. The Target Schema's assay enum includes \"whole genome sequencing\" as one of the options. The input is \"WGS\", which is an acronym for that term. Since \"whole genome sequencing\" is the exact term in the schema, I should replace \"WGS\" with \"whole genome sequencing\".\n\nNow, the tumorType is \"MPN tumor\". The Target Schema's tumorType enum includes \"Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor\". \"MPNST\" is a common abbreviation for that. The input says \"MPN tumor\", which is likely a typo or shorthand for MPNST. So I need to map \"MPN tumor\" to \"Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor\" as per the schema.\n\nLet me double-check each replacement to ensure they match the exact terms in the enums. Diagnosis: \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\" is correct. Assay: \"whole genome sequencing\" is present. TumorType: \"Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor\" is in the list.

The user provided an input JSON with three fields: diagnosis, assay, and tumorType. My job is to replace any synonyms in these fields with the exact terms from the Target Schema.\n\nFirst, looking at the diagnosis. The input is \"Von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis\". I remember that Von Recklinghausen's disease is another name for Neurofibromatosis type 1. Checking the Target Schema's diagnosis enum, I see \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\" listed. So that's the correct replacement.\n\nNext, the assay is \"MRS\". The Target Schema's assay enum includes \"magnetic resonance spectroscopy\". MRS is a common abbreviation for Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, so I should replace \"MRS\" with the full term from the enum.\n\nFor tumorType, the input is \"NOS\". In medical terminology, NOS stands for \"Not Otherwise Specified\". Looking at the tumorType enum, there's \"Not Applicable\" and \"Unknown\", but also \"High-Grade Glioma NOS\" and \"Low-Grade Glioma NOS\". Wait, but the input's tumorType is just \"NOS\", which doesn't specify a glioma. The schema's tumorType enum has \"Not Applicable\" and \"Unknown\". Since \"NOS\" in this context might mean the tumor type isn't specified, but the schema doesn't have a general \"NOS\" option. The closest might be \"Not Applicable\" or \"Unknown\". However, \"Not Applicable\" is in the tumorType enum. But I need to check if \"NOS\" in the input corresponds to a specific entry. Wait, the schema's tumorType has \"Schwannomatosis-NOS\" in diagnosis, but that's under diagnosis, not tumorType. For tumorType, the options are \"Not Applicable\" and \"Unknown\". Since \"NOS\" here might mean the tumor type isn't specified, but \"Not Applicable\" is for when it's not relevant, and \"Unknown\" when it's not known. The input's tumorType is \"NOS\", which is a way of saying not otherwise specified, but in the context of the schema, the correct term would be \"Unknown\" if the type isn't specified, or maybe \"Not Applicable\" if it's not applicable. However, the input's tumorType is \"NOS\", which isn't directly in the tumorType enum. The schema's tumorType has \"High-Grade Glioma NOS\" and \"Low-Grade Glioma NOS\", but those are specific to glioma. Since the input's tumorType is just \"NOS\" without context, perhaps the correct term is \"Unknown\" because it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe \"Not Applicable\" if it's not applicable. But without more context, \"Unknown\" seems safer. Wait, looking back at the Target Schema's tumorType enum, \"Not Applicable\" and \"Unknown\" are both options. Since \"NOS\" in medical terms is used when a more specific classification isn't available, but in the schema, if there's no \"NOS\" option for tumorType, then \"Unknown\" would be the appropriate choice. So I'll replace \"NOS\" with \"Unknown\".\n\nSo the corrected JSON should be:\n\ndiagnosis: \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\"\n\nassay: \"magnetic resonance spectroscopy\"\n\ntumorType: \"Unknown\"\n",

I remember that Von Recklinghausen's disease is another name for Neurofibromatosis type 1. Checking the Target Schema's diagnosis enum, I see \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\" listed.

Looking at the tumorType enum, there's \"Not Applicable\" and \"Unknown\", but also \"High-Grade Glioma NOS\" and \"Low-Grade Glioma NOS\".

Since \"NOS\" in this context might mean the tumor type isn't specified, but the schema doesn't have a general \"NOS\" option. The closest might be \"Not Applicable\" or \"Unknown\". However, \"Not Applicable\" is in the tumorType enum. But I need to check if \"NOS\" in the input corresponds to a specific entry. Wait, the schema's tumorType has \"Schwannomatosis-NOS\" in diagnosis, but that's under diagnosis, not tumorType. For tumorType, the options are \"Not Applicable\" and \"Unknown\".

So the corrected diagnosis should be \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\".\n\nNext, the \"assay\" field is \"ICC\". The Target Schema's assay enum includes \"immunocytochemistry\". \"ICC\" is a common abbreviation for immunocytochemistry, so I should replace \"ICC\" with \"immunocytochemistry\".\n\nThen, the \"tumorType\" is \"localized neurofibroma\".

The user provided an input JSON with three fields: diagnosis, assay, and tumorType. My job is to replace any synonyms in these fields with the exact terms from the Target Schema.\n\nFirst, looking at the diagnosis field. The input is \"Neurofibromatosis-1\". The Target Schema's diagnosis enum includes \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\". The hyphen and the word \"type\" versus \"-1\" are the differences here. Since \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\" is the exact term in the schema, I should replace \"Neurofibromatosis-1\" with that. That seems straightforward.\n\nNext, the assay field. The input is \"magnetic resonance imaging\". The Target Schema's assay enum has several MRI-related entries. Let me check: \"conventional MRI\", \"Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo MRI\", \"functional MRI\", \"resting state functional MRI\", \"structural MRI\". The term \"magnetic resonance imaging\" is the full form of MRI. The schema uses \"conventional MRI\" as one of the options. So \"magnetic resonance imaging\" should map to \"conventional MRI\". That makes sense because \"conventional MRI\" is the standard term listed, and the full name is a synonym.\n\nThen, the tumorType is \"not determined\". The Target Schema's tumorType enum includes \"Unknown\" and \"Not Applicable\". \"Not determined\" isn't listed, but \"Unknown\" is. Since \"not determined\" implies that the tumor type isn't known, \"Unknown\" is the appropriate term here. \"Not Applicable\" would be used if the field doesn't apply, which isn't the case here. So replacing \"not determined\" with \"Unknown\" is correct.\n\nI need to make sure that all replacements are exact matches from the enums. No variations allowed.
