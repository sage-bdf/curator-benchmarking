Let me start by getting the access requirements.\n\n## Step 1: Getting Access Requirements\n\n```json\nPOST https://repo-prod.prod.sagebase.org/repo/v1/restrictionInformation\n{\n  \"objectId\": \"syn51513068\",\n  \"restrictableObjectType\": \"ENTITY\"\n}\n```\n\n## Step 2: Getting ACL Information\n\nBased on the restriction information response, I'll retrieve the ACL for each access requirement found.\n\nLet me execute these calls:\n\n---\n\n**Note**: Since I'm an AI assistant, I cannot make actual HTTP requests to external APIs. However, I can provide you with the exact format and process to retrieve this information.\n\nTo get the ACL information for syn51513068, you would need to:\n\n1. **First API Call** - Get restriction information:\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://repo-prod.prod.sagebase.org/repo/v1/restrictionInformation \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN\" \\\n  -d '{\"objectId\": \"syn51513068\", \"restrictableObjectType\": \"ENTITY\"}'\n```\n\n2. **Second API Call** - For each `accessRequirementId` in the response, get the ACL:\n```bash\ncurl -X GET https://repo-prod.prod.sagebase.org/repo/v1/accessRequirement/{requirementId}/acl \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Expected Response Format\n\nOnce you execute these calls, the response will be structured as:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"hasAccessRequirements\": true,\n  \"aclSummary\": [\n    {\n      \"requirementId\": \"Retrieved from API\",\n      \"aclId\": \"Retrieved from ACL response\",\n      \"managedBy\": \"Principal IDs or team names with management permissions\",\n      \"permissions\": [\"REVIEW_SUBMISSIONS\", \"EXEMPTION_ELIGIBLE\", \"etc.\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"dataUseSummary\": \"Researchers interested in accessing syn51513068 should contact the access management team (details from ACL). The team will review data access requests to ensure appropriate use according to the data governance requirements.\"\n}\n```\n\n**To complete this task, you'll need:**\n- A valid Synapse authentication token\n- Permission to view the dataset's access requirements\n- Execute the two API calls in sequence\n\nWould you like me to provide example code in a specific programming language (Python, R, etc.) to automate this process?"
