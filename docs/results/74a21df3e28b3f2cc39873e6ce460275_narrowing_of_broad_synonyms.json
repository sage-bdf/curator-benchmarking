Likely relevant is \"Neuromet\" hmm. In list there is \"Schwannomatosis\", \"NF2-related schwannomatosis\", etc. \" neurocristopathy\" is gene or disease, but the target diagnosis values: maybe \"Schwannomatosis\" is the relevant. So we can replace diagnosis with \"Schwannomatosis\". Might also choose \"Unknown\" but \"neurocristopathy\" likely kind of refers to multiple nerve sheath tumors? Neurocristopathies refer to defects in neural crest cell development, includes neurofibromatosis. So we can choose \"Schwannomatosis\" or \"NF1-Associated Tumor\"? Wait that's tumor type. So choose \"Schwannomatosis\" as a diagnosis. But we need to see severity: there's no exact match for \"neurocristopathy\". So should replace with nearest concept: \"Schwannomatosis\". Because that is a diagnosis.\n\nNext, assay: \"transcriptomics\" is a broad term. In enumeration, there is \"RNA-seq\", \"RNA array\", \"spatial transcriptomics\", \"spatial transcriptomics assay\", possibly \"whole transcriptome sequencing\". \"transcriptomics\" as broad can refer to \"RNA-seq\". The most common is \"RNA-seq\". Use \"RNA-seq\".\n\nNext, tumorType: \"neurolemmoma\" is a synonym for schwannoma. Actually, \"neurolemmoma\" is a schwannoma tumor. In enumeration, there is \"Schwannoma\". So replace with \"Schwannoma\".\n\nThus output JSON:\n\n{\n  \"diagnosis\": \"Schwannomatosis\",\n  \"assay\": \"RNA-seq\",\n  \"tumorType\": \"Schwannoma\"\n}\n\nNeed to ensure we output JSON with same structure. Yes. Also orders maintain same. Should match exactly enumerated values. Confirm \"Schwannomatosis\" is in list.
