The user provided a grid structure and wants me to list the column names in order. First, I need to parse the input data correctly. The input has a \"grid_structure\" which is a JSON string. So, I should parse that string into a JSON object.\n\nLooking at the grid_structure value, it's a string that represents a JSON object with a \"columns\" array. Each element in the array has a \"name\" and \"type\". My task is to extract all the \"name\" values from each column in the order they appear.\n\nLet me check the structure again. The grid_structure is: {\"columns\": [{\"name\": \"timestamp\", \"type\": \"datetime\"}, {\"name\": \"event\", \"type\": \"string\"}, {\"name\": \"severity\", \"type\": \"string\"}]}. So, parsing this, the columns are timestamp, event, and severity. \n\nI need to make sure that the order is preserved. The columns array in the output should list them in the same order as they appear in the input. Also, the response should be a JSON object with a \"columns\" key and an array of the names. \n\nI should verify that there are no typos in the names. Let me double-check each name against the input. Timestamp, event, severity\u2014all spelled correctly. \n\nNow, constructing the JSON response. The output should be a JSON object with the \"columns\" array. So, the final answer should look like:\n\n{\n  \"columns\": [\"timestamp\", \"event\", \"severity\"]\n}\n\nI need to ensure that the JSON is properly formatted, with quotes around the keys and values, and commas in the right places. No trailing commas. Also, the order of the columns is crucial here. Since the input lists timestamp first, then event, then severity, the output must follow the same sequence.\n\nI think that's all. No other columns are present, and the input doesn't mention any additional data. So the answer should be straightforward.\n",
