Since the query phrase is \"neuroscience\", the JSON would be {\"query\":\"neuroscience\"}.\n\nNow, I need to URL-encode this JSON. Encoding the curly braces and quotes: the curly braces become %7B and %7D, the quotes become %22, and the colon becomes %3A. So the encoded string is %7B%22query%22%3A%22neuroscience%22%7D.\n\nPutting it all together, the full URL is the base URL followed by the encoded JSON. Checking the example provided, the structure matches. There are no facets mentioned in the query, so the JSON doesn't need any additional parameters. \n\nDouble-checking the encoding to ensure there are no mistakes.

The user wants to find Biolink standards with AI applications using the Bridge2AI platform.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the base URL for Bridge2AI, which is given as https://b2ai.standards.synapse.org/Explore/?QueryWrapper0=. The next step is to construct the JSON object with the query and any facets. The query phrase provided is \"find biolink standards with AI Applications\". I should extract the key terms here. The main terms are \"biolink standards\" and \"AI Applications\". So the query string should probably be \"biolink standards AI Applications\" or a similar combination. \n\nThe example given in the instructions for Bridge2AI used \"genomics data standards\" from the query phrase \"data standards for genomics\", so it seems like the query is rephrased to be more concise, possibly combining the main terms. So here, \"biolink standards AI Applications\" makes sense. \n\nNow, do we need any facets? The user didn't specify any filters like category or organization, so the facets part is optional. The example didn't include facets when they weren't needed. So the JSON should just have the query field.\n\nNext, I need to URL-encode the JSON. The JSON structure is {\"query\":\"biolink standards AI Applications\"}. Let's make sure to use proper JSON syntax with quotes and colons. Then, URL-encode this string. The spaces become %20, quotes become %22, and the colon becomes %3A. \n\nPutting it all together, the base URL plus the encoded JSON gives the final query wrapper URL. Let me double-check the encoding. The original JSON is {\"query\":\"biolink standards AI applications\"}. When encoded, the curly braces become %7B and %7D, the quotes are %22, the colon is %3A, and the spaces are %20. \n\nWait, the user's query phrase uses \"AI Applications\" with a capital A, but in the example, the query was in lowercase. Does case matter here? Probably not, since search queries are usually case-insensitive. But to be precise, I'll keep the capitalization as given unless instructed otherwise. However, in the example, \"genomics data standards\" was all lowercase. Hmm. Maybe the system is case-insensitive, so it's safer to use the exact casing provided by the user. So \"AI Applications\" remains with capital letters.\n\nSo the JSON is {\"query\":\"biolink standards AI Applications\"}, which when URL-encoded becomes %7B%22query%22%3A%22biolink%20standards%20AI%20Applications%22%7D. \n\nCombining this with the base URL gives the complete URL. Let me verify by breaking it down. The base URL is correct. The encoded JSON starts with %7B (for {), then %22query%22 (for \"query\"), %3A (for :), %22 (for \"), then the query terms separated by %20. Finally, closing with %22 (for \") and %7D (for }).\n\nYes, that looks right. No facets are included since none were specified. The platform is Bridge2AI, so the JSON response should have \"platform\": \"Bridge2AI\" and the queryWrapper as the constructed URL.\n",

The user wants a query wrapper for the phrase \"cell lines derived from NF tumors\" on the NF Research Tools Central platform.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the base URL for NF Tools, which is https://nf.synapse.org/Explore/Tools?QueryWrapper0=. \n\nNext, the query phrase. The original phrase is \"cell lines derived from NF tumors\". I should simplify this into a search query. The key terms here are \"cell lines\" and \"NF tumors\". So the query string could be \"cell lines NF tumors\". Maybe rephrase it to \"NF tumor cell lines\" to make it more concise and relevant. That might yield better results.\n\nNow, construct the JSON object. The structure requires \"query\" and optionally \"facets\". The example given didn't use facets, so unless there are specific filters mentioned, I'll stick to just the query. So the JSON would be {\"query\":\"NF tumor cell lines\"}.\n\nNext step is to URL-encode this JSON. The encoding process involves converting spaces to %20, quotes to %22, colons to %3A, etc. Let's check each character:\n\n- { becomes %7B\n- \" becomes %22\n- : becomes %3A\n- The comma stays as is, but in URL encoding, it's %2C, but in the example, they didn't encode the comma. Wait, looking at the example: the example for Bridge2AI had \"genomics data standards\" encoded as \"genomics%20data%20standards\". The JSON was {\"query\":\"genomics data standards\"}, which when encoded becomes %7B%22query%22%3A%22genomics%20data%20standards%22%7D. So spaces in the query value are replaced with %20, and the JSON syntax characters like {, \", : are encoded.\n\nSo for {\"query\":\"NF tumor cell lines\"}, the encoding would be:\n\n%7B%22query%22%3A%22NF%20tumor%20cell%20lines%22%7D\n\nPutting it all together, the full URL is the base URL plus the encoded JSON. Let me double-check the encoding. Yes, each space in the query is %20, and the JSON structure is properly encoded. The platform is \"NF Tools\" as specified.\n",

                        "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a query wrapper for the phrase \"cell lines derived from NF tumors\" on the NF Research Tools Central platform.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the base URL for NF Tools, which is https://nf.synapse.org/Explore/Tools?QueryWrapper0=. \n\nNext, the query phrase. The original phrase is \"cell lines derived from NF tumors\". I should simplify this into a search query. The key terms here are \"cell lines\" and \"NF tumors\". So the query string could be \"cell lines NF tumors\". Maybe rephrase it to \"NF tumor cell lines\" to make it more concise and relevant. That might yield better results.\n\nNow, construct the JSON object. The structure requires \"query\" and optionally \"facets\". The example given didn't use facets, so unless there are specific filters mentioned, I'll stick to just the query. So the JSON would be {\"query\":\"NF tumor cell lines\"}.\n\nNext step is to URL-encode this JSON. The encoding process involves converting spaces to %20, quotes to %22, colons to %3A, etc. Let's check each character:\n\n- { becomes %7B\n- \" becomes %22\n- : becomes %3A\n- The comma stays as is, but in URL encoding, it's %2C, but in the example, they didn't encode the comma. Wait, looking at the example: the example for Bridge2AI had \"genomics data standards\" encoded as \"genomics%20data%20standards\". The JSON was {\"query\":\"genomics data standards\"}, which when encoded becomes %7B%22query%22%3A%22genomics%20data%20standards%22%7D. So spaces in the query value are replaced with %20, and the JSON syntax characters like {, \", : are encoded.\n\nSo for {\"query\":\"NF tumor cell lines\"}, the encoding would be:\n\n%7B%22query%22%3A%22NF%20tumor%20cell%20lines%22%7D\n\nPutting it all together, the full URL is the base URL plus the encoded JSON. Let me double-check the encoding. Yes, each space in the query is %20, and the JSON structure is properly encoded. The platform is \"NF Tools\" as specified.\n"
