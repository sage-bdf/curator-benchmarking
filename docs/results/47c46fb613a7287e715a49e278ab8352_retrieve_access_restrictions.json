Researchers need to log into Synapse, navigate to the dataset page, review the terms of use agreement, and click 'I Agree' to gain access. Once accepted, the data can be downloaded and used according to the specified terms and conditions.\"\n}\n```\n\nThe dataset syn51513065 has a self-sign access requirement, which is a relatively straightforward restriction. Users simply need to review and accept the terms of use to gain access to the data. This is more restrictive than open access but less restrictive than managed access requirements that would require approval from data controllers."
