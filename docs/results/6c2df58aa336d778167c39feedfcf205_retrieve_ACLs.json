The ACT has full permissions to review and approve access requests. Researchers who want to use this dataset will need to submit an access request that will be reviewed by the ACT. To get access, you should: (1) Navigate to the dataset page on Synapse, (2) Click the 'Request Access' button if available, (3) Complete any required data use certifications or agreements, and (4) Submit your request for ACT review. For questions about access, you can contact the ACT through the Synapse help system or at act@synapse.org. The presence of access requirements indicates this is a controlled-access dataset with specific terms of use that must be agreed to before data can be downloaded or used.\"\n}\n```\n\n**Key Points for Researchers:**\n- This dataset has controlled access managed by Synapse's ACT\n- You cannot directly download the data without approval\n- The ACT (team ID 464532) reviews all access requests\n- You'll need to formally request access through the Synapse platform\n- Approval is required before you can use this data in your research"
