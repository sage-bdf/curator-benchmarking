The input data has a \"grid_structure\" field which is a string that looks like JSON. So first, I need to parse that string into a JSON object.\n\nLooking at the grid_structure value: it's a JSON string with a \"columns\" array. Each element in the array has a \"name\" and \"type\". My task is to extract all the \"name\" values from each column in the order they appear.\n\nSo step by step: parse the grid_structure string into an object. Then iterate over the columns array, collect each \"name\" property. Then return them in a JSON object with a \"columns\" array.\n\nWait, the input's grid_structure is a string, so I need to parse it. For example, the value is \"{\\\"columns\\\": [{\\\"name\\\": \\\"a\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"integer\\\"}, {\\\"name\\\": \\\"b\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"string\\\"}]}\". When parsed, that becomes an object with a columns array containing two elements. Their names are \"a\" and \"b\".\n\nSo the output should be a JSON object with \"columns\": [\"a\", \"b\"]. That's straightforward. Just make sure the order is preserved as in the original array. Also, check if there are any other possible columns or nested structures, but in this case, each column is an object in the columns array, and we just need the \"name\" field.\n\nNo other complexities here. The answer should be the list of names in the given order.\n",

First, I need to parse that JSON string to get the actual columns array.\n\nLooking at the grid_structure value, it's a string that represents a JSON object with a \"columns\" key. Each element in the columns array has a \"name\" and \"type\". So, I need to extract all the \"name\" values from each column definition.\n\nThe steps I should take are: \n1. Parse the grid_structure string into a JSON object.\n2. Access the \"columns\" array within that object.\n3. Iterate over each item in the columns array and collect the \"name\" values.\n4. Ensure the order of the columns is preserved as they appear in the array.\n\nWait, the input's grid_structure is already a string, so I need to parse it correctly. Let me check the example. The grid_structure is \"{\\\"columns\\\": [...]}\" which when parsed would give an object with columns array. Each column has a name. So, after parsing, the columns array will have the names in order: subject, treatment, outcome, score.\n\nSo the final list should be [\"subject\", \"treatment\", \"outcome\", \"score\"]. I need to make sure that the JSON response follows the structure specified, with a \"columns\" array containing these names in order. No other processing is needed here. Just extract the names in the given order.\n"
