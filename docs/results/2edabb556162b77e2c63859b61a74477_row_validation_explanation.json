The user provided a row with some data and validation errors, and I need to explain why the row is invalid.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the input data. The row_data is a JSON object. The row has an ID of 1, and two columns: \"a\" with a null value and \"b\" with the value \"no id\". The validation error listed is \"Column 'a' is required but is null\".\n\nSo, the main issue here is with column 'a'. The error message clearly states that this column is required, meaning it can't be null. Even though column 'b' has a value of \"no id\", the validation error doesn't mention it. Therefore, the problem is solely with column 'a' being null when it's mandatory.\n\nI need to structure the explanation to reference the specific error and the problematic column. The explanation should mention that column 'a' is required but is null, leading to the row being invalid. Since the error list only includes that one error, I don't need to address column 'b' unless there's another error, which there isn't here.\n\nSo the JSON response should have an explanation that points out the required column 'a' is null, causing the validation failure.\n",

The user provided a row of data with validation errors and wants an explanation.

The validation error is about the end_date not being after the start_date. \n\nSo the main issue here is the dates. The end_date is set to a date that's before the start_date. In most cases, an end date should come after the start date to make logical sense. For example, an event can't end before it starts. \n\nI need to mention the specific columns involved: start_date and end_date. The problem is that the end_date (2023-12-31) is earlier than the start_date (2024-01-01). The validation error directly points this out. \n\nThe explanation should clearly state that the end_date is before the start_date, referencing the actual dates provided. It should also note that this violates the validation rule requiring end_date to be after start_date. \n\nI need to structure the JSON response with an explanation field. The explanation must be concise but detailed enough to point out the columns and the date values causing the conflict. Let me make sure I don't include any extra information beyond the validation error provided. \n\nDouble-checking the dates: 2023-12-31 is indeed the day before 2024-01-01. So the end_date is one day prior, which is invalid. The error message is accurate. \n\nTherefore, the explanation should highlight the end_date being before the start_date as the reason for the validation error.\n",
