The user provided an input with three fields: diagnosis, assay, and tumorType. My job is to replace any narrow synonyms with the broader terms from the Target Schema.\n\nFirst, looking at the diagnosis: \"Neurofibromatosis type 1 microdeletion syndrome\". The Target Schema's diagnosis enum includes \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\". Since \"microdeletion syndrome\" is a specific subtype, I should broaden it to the more general term. So, replace the entire diagnosis with \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\".\n\nNext, the assay is \"clinical whole-exome sequencing\". The Target Schema's assay enum has \"whole exome sequencing\". The word \"clinical\" here is probably a descriptor, so removing it makes it match the controlled term exactly. So, assay becomes \"whole exome sequencing\".\n\nFor tumorType: \"Plexiform neurofibroma (morphologic abnormality)\". The Target Schema lists \"Plexiform Neurofibroma\". The part in parentheses is extra detail that's not part of the controlled term. Also, the capitalization should match, so changing to the exact enum value. Therefore, tumorType becomes \"Plexiform Neurofibroma\".\n\nI need to ensure that all replacements use the exact terms from the schema, without any variations. Check each enum list again to confirm the correct terms. No typos or extra words allowed. The JSON structure should remain the same, just with the corrected values.\n",

Diagnosis: \"neurofibromatosis, familial spinal\" was mapped to \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\" as this is the standardized term for spinal neurofibromatosis in the target schema\n2. Assay: \"open MRI\" was broadened to \"conventional MRI\" (the exact term from the assay enum list)\n3. TumorType: \"unknown - no information available\" was standardized to \"Unknown\" (the exact null value from tumorType enum list)\n\nAll replacements use exact values from the controlled terminology in the target schema.Okay, let's tackle this metadata curation task. The user wants me to broaden narrow synonyms in the input metadata using the exact terms from the Target Schema.\n\nFirst, looking at the diagnosis field. The input is \"neurofibromatosis, familial spinal\". The Target Schema's diagnosis enum includes \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\". Since \"familial spinal\" is a specific type, but the schema doesn't have that exact term. The closest broader term is \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\" because spinal neurofibromatosis is often associated with NF1. So I'll replace it with that.\n\nNext, the assay is \"open MRI\". The Target Schema's assay enum has \"conventional MRI\" and \"Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo MRI\". \"Open MRI\" is a type of MRI machine, but the schema doesn't list it. The broader term here would be \"conventional MRI\" as it's the standard term. So I'll change \"open MRI\" to \"conventional MRI\".\n\nFor tumorType, the input is \"unknown - no information available\". The Target Schema's tumorType enum has \"Unknown\".

My job is to replace any narrow synonyms with the broader terms from the Target Schema.\n\nFirst, the diagnosis is \"Neurofibromatosis type 1 with scoliosis\". The Target Schema's diagnosis enum includes \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\". The original term adds \"with scoliosis\", which is a specific manifestation. Since the schema doesn't include that qualifier, I should remove it to match the standard term. So, diagnosis becomes \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\".\n\nNext, the assay is \"anti-tag immunocytochemistry\". Looking at the assay enum, there's \"immunocytochemistry\" listed. The prefix \"anti-tag\" seems to be a specific detail about the method, which isn't part of the controlled term. So, I'll drop that part and use \"immunocytochemistry\".\n\nFor tumorType, the input is \"sessile cutaneous neurofibroma\". The Target Schema's tumorType enum has \"Cutaneous Neurofibroma\". The term \"sessile\" describes the growth pattern but isn't part of the standard term. Therefore, I should simplify it to \"Cutaneous Neurofibroma\".\n\nI need to ensure all replacements exactly match the enum values. No extra words or variations. Check each field again to confirm. Diagnosis: correct. Assay: correct. TumorType: correct. All match the Target Schema now.\n"
