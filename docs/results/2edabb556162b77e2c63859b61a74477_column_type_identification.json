The task is to find the data type of the \"timestamp\" column.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the grid_structure JSON. The columns array has three entries. Each has a name and type. The column named \"timestamp\" has its type listed as \"datetime\". \n\nSo, the answer should be straightforward. The type is \"datetime\". I just need to return that in the specified JSON format. Let me double-check to make sure there's no mistake. The column name matches exactly, and the type is correctly noted. Yep, looks right. No other data types here to confuse it with. The output should be {\"type\": \"datetime\"}.\n",
