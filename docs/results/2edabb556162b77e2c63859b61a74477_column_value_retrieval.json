The input data includes a row_data JSON string, a column name, and a question. My task is to parse the row_data, find the specified column, and return its value in the correct format.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the row_data.

The column_name provided is \"value\", so I need to look into the columns object of the row_data.\n\nLooking at the columns, the \"value\" key has 3.14. The instructions say to return the value as the correct type\u2014number, string, or null. Since 3.14 is a number, the JSON response should have it as a number, not a string. Also, the structure should be a JSON object with the key \"value\".\n\nI need to make sure there are no typos in the JSON keys. The column_name matches exactly with the key in columns. The output should be {\"value\": 3.14} without any quotes around the number. If the value was a string like \"Test\", it would be in quotes. Null would be returned as null. Since 3.14 is a float, it's correctly represented as a number in JSON.\n\nDouble-checking everything: parsed row_data correctly, accessed the columns, found the right column name, and formatted the response properly.

My task is to parse the row_data, find the specified column, and return its value in the correct format.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the row_data. The row_data is a JSON string, so I should convert it into a JSON object. The row_data has \"row_id\" and \"columns\". The columns are another object containing the actual data: id, name, and value. The column_name provided is \"value\", so I need to look into the columns object of the row_data.\n\nLooking at the columns, the \"value\" key has 3.14. The instructions say to return the value as the correct type\u2014number, string, or null. Since 3.14 is a number, the JSON response should have it as a number, not a string. Also, the structure should be a JSON object with the key \"value\".\n\nI need to make sure there are no typos in the JSON keys. The column_name matches exactly with the key in columns. The output should be {\"value\": 3.14} without any quotes around the number. If the value was a string like \"Test\", it would be in quotes. Null would be returned as null. Since 3.14 is a float, it's correctly represented as a number in JSON.\n\nDouble-checking everything: parsed row_data correctly, accessed the columns, found the right column name, and formatted the response properly. All steps seem correct. No errors in the logic here.\n"
