Let me parse that first.\n\nThe grid_structure is: {\"columns\": [{\"name\": \"a\", \"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"name\": \"b\", \"type\": \"string\"}]}. So when I parse this, it's an object with a columns array. Each column has a name and type. \n\nLooking at the columns array, the first element has name \"a\" and type \"integer\". The second is \"b\" with type \"string\". The column_name provided in the input is \"a\". So I just need to look for the column with name \"a\" and return its type. \n\nThe type here is \"integer\". The question is asking for the type of column a, so the answer should be \"integer\". I need to make sure that the JSON output is correctly formatted with the type key and the value as \"integer\".
