The user wants a query wrapper URL for the Bridge2AI Standards Explorer with the search term \"neuroscience\". \n\nFirst, I need to remember the structure for Bridge2AI. The base URL is https://b2ai.standards.synapse.org/Explore/?QueryWrapper0= followed by URL-encoded JSON. The JSON should have a \"query\" field. The example given was \"genomics data standards\" which became \"genomics%20data%20standards\" in the URL.\n\nSo, the original query phrase here is \"neuroscience\". I need to create a JSON object like {\"query\": \"neuroscience\"}. Then, I have to URL-encode this JSON. \n\nLet me check the encoding. The JSON string is {\"query\":\"neuroscience\"}, which when URL-encoded becomes %7B%22query%22%3A%22neuroscience%22%7D. \n\nPutting it all together, the base URL plus the encoded JSON gives the full URL. I should make sure there are no typos. The platform specified is Bridge2AI, so the platform field in the response should be \"Bridge2AI\". \n\nDouble-checking the example provided, the structure seems correct. No facets are mentioned here, so the JSON only includes the query. Alright, that should be it.\n",

The user wants to find Biolink standards with AI applications using the Bridge2AI Standards Explorer. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the query phrase. The key terms here are \"Biolink standards\" and \"AI Applications\". The target platform is Bridge2AI, so the base URL is https://b2ai.standards.synapse.org/Explore/?QueryWrapper0=.\n\nNext, I'll structure the JSON parameters. The main query should combine the terms. Maybe \"biolink standards AI applications\" as the query string. Since the example used a similar structure without facets, unless there's a specific facet category related to AI applications, I might not need facets here. The example didn't use facets, so perhaps it's safe to omit them unless specified. \n\nNow, I need to URL-encode the JSON. The JSON object would be {\"query\":\"biolink standards AI applications\"}. Encoding this, the spaces become %20, quotes become %22, and the colon is %3A. Let me check the encoding. The original example had \"genomics data standards\" encoded as \"genomics%20data%20standards\". So replacing spaces with %20 and ensuring proper encoding. \n\nPutting it all together, the URL would start with the base URL, followed by the encoded JSON. Let me verify the encoding step-by-step. The JSON string is {\"query\":\"biolink standards AI applications\"}, which when URL-encoded becomes %7B%22query%22%3A%22biolink%20standards%20AI%20applications%22%7D. \n\nYes, that looks right.

The example used \"genomics data standards\" which became \"genomics%20data%20standards\", so the structure matches.

The user wants a query wrapper for the NF Research Tools Central. The query phrase is \"cell lines derived from NF tumors\". First, I need to parse the query to understand what they're looking for. They're interested in cell lines that come from NF tumors. Since the target platform is NF Tools, I should focus on the structure required for that URL.\n\nThe base URL is https://nf.synapse.org/Explore/Tools?QueryWrapper0=, and the query wrapper uses URL-encoded JSON. The main component is the \"query\" field. The example given was \"genomic analysis tools\" becoming \"genomic%20analysis%20tools\". So, I need to take the user's phrase and format it into a search query. \n\nThe original phrase is \"cell lines derived from NF tumors\". To make this a concise search query, I can simplify it to \"cell lines NF tumors\". Removing \"derived from\" makes it more keyword-focused. Then, I need to URL-encode the JSON. The JSON structure should be {\"query\":\"cell lines NF tumors\"}. \n\nNext, I need to URL-encode this JSON. The spaces become %20, quotes become %22, and the colons and braces are converted to their respective encodings. Let me check: the JSON is {\"query\":\"cell lines NF tumors\"}, which when URL-encoded becomes %7B%22query%22%3A%22cell%20lines%20NF%20tumors%22%7D. \n\nPutting it all together, the full URL is the base URL followed by the encoded JSON.

Just the \"query\" field. Alright, that should be it. The final URL should be https://nf.synapse.org/Explore/Tools?QueryWrapper0=%7B%22query%22%3A%22cell%20lines%20NF%20tumors%22%7D.\n",

                        "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a query wrapper for the NF Research Tools Central. The query phrase is \"cell lines derived from NF tumors\". First, I need to parse the query to understand what they're looking for. They're interested in cell lines that come from NF tumors. Since the target platform is NF Tools, I should focus on the structure required for that URL.\n\nThe base URL is https://nf.synapse.org/Explore/Tools?QueryWrapper0=, and the query wrapper uses URL-encoded JSON. The main component is the \"query\" field. The example given was \"genomic analysis tools\" becoming \"genomic%20analysis%20tools\". So, I need to take the user's phrase and format it into a search query. \n\nThe original phrase is \"cell lines derived from NF tumors\". To make this a concise search query, I can simplify it to \"cell lines NF tumors\". Removing \"derived from\" makes it more keyword-focused. Then, I need to URL-encode the JSON. The JSON structure should be {\"query\":\"cell lines NF tumors\"}. \n\nNext, I need to URL-encode this JSON. The spaces become %20, quotes become %22, and the colons and braces are converted to their respective encodings. Let me check: the JSON is {\"query\":\"cell lines NF tumors\"}, which when URL-encoded becomes %7B%22query%22%3A%22cell%20lines%20NF%20tumors%22%7D. \n\nPutting it all together, the full URL is the base URL followed by the encoded JSON. Let me verify with an example. If the example had \"genomic analysis tools\" encoded as %22genomic%20analysis%20tools%22, then my encoding should be correct. \n\nI don't see any facets mentioned in the query, so the JSON doesn't need any additional parameters. Just the \"query\" field. Alright, that should be it. The final URL should be https://nf.synapse.org/Explore/Tools?QueryWrapper0=%7B%22query%22%3A%22cell%20lines%20NF%20tumors%22%7D.\n"

The user wants to find \"antibodies for NF1 protein\" using the NF Research Tools Central platform.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the structure for the NF Tools query wrapper. The base URL is https://nf.synapse.org/Explore/Tools?QueryWrapper0=, and the parameters are a URL-encoded JSON object with \"query\" and optional \"facets\".\n\nThe query phrase here is \"antibodies for NF1 protein\". The main keywords are \"antibodies\" and \"NF1 protein\". I should construct the query string by combining these terms. Maybe \"NF1 protein antibodies\" or \"antibodies NF1 protein\". The example given in the instructions used a similar structure, like changing \"tools for analyzing genomic data\" to \"genomic analysis tools\". So here, rephrasing to \"NF1 protein antibodies\" makes sense.\n\nNext, check if any facets apply. The facets for NF Tools include toolType, inputDataType, nfRelated. The user is looking for antibodies, which might fall under a specific toolType. Looking at possible toolType options, maybe \"Reagent\" or \"Antibody\" is a category. If \"Antibody\" is a valid toolType, adding that as a facet would filter results better.\n\nSo the JSON should be {\"query\":\"NF1 protein antibodies\", \"facets\":{\"toolType\":[\"Antibody\"]}}. Then, this needs to be URL-encoded. \n\nWait, but I need to confirm if \"Antibody\" is indeed a valid toolType in the NF Tools. Since the user is asking for antibodies, it's logical that the toolType would include that. If unsure, maybe include it anyway, as the example didn't use facets but the user might benefit from the filter. Alternatively, if the facet isn't correct, the search might still work without it. But including it could make the results more precise.\n\nAssuming \"toolType\": \"Antibody\" is valid, the facets part would be added. Then, encode the JSON. Let's structure it properly. The JSON object is {\"query\":\"NF1 protein antibodies\",\"facets\":{\"toolType\":[\"Antibody\"]}}. \n\nURL-encoding this JSON: the spaces become %20, quotes become %22, colons %3A, commas %2C, braces %7B and %7D, brackets %5B and %5D. Let me construct the encoded string.\n\nOriginal JSON:\n{\"query\":\"NF1 protein antibodies\",\"facets\":{\"toolType\":[\"Antibody\"]}}\n\nEncoded:\n%7B%22query%22%3A%22NF1%20protein%20antibodies%22%2C%22facets%22%3A%7B%22toolType%22%3A%5B%22Antibody%22%5D%7D%7D\n\nPutting it all together, the full URL is:\nhttps://nf.synapse.org/Explore/Tools?QueryWrapper0=%7B%22query%22%3A%22NF1%20protein%20antibodies%22%2C%22facets%22%3A%7B%22toolType%22%3A%5B%22Antibody%22%5D%7D%7D\n\nI think that's correct.
