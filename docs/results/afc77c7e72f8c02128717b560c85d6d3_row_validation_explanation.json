The user provided a row of data with some validation errors and wants to know why the row is invalid.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input data. The row_data is a JSON string.

The error message directly points out that 'a' is missing. Even though column 'b' has a value \"no id\", the problem is with 'a'. The presence of a validation error about 'a' being null when it's required makes the entire row invalid. \n\nI should explain that the row is invalid because column 'a' is required but has a null value. I need to mention the specific column and the issue. The explanation should reference the error message and the problematic value.

The status is \"active\", which might be correct, but the error doesn't mention it. So the only problem is the email format.
