The user provided an input with three fields: diagnosis, assay, and tumorType. My job is to replace any narrow synonyms with the broader terms from the Target Schema.\n\nFirst, looking at the diagnosis: \"Neurofibromatosis type 1 microdeletion syndrome\". The Target Schema's diagnosis enum includes \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\". The term \"microdeletion syndrome\" here is a specific subtype, so I should broaden it to the more general \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\".\n\nNext, the assay is \"clinical whole-exome sequencing\". The Target Schema's assay enum has \"whole exome sequencing\". The input uses \"clinical\" and hyphenates \"whole-exome\", but the schema uses \"whole exome\" without a hyphen. So I need to adjust it to match exactly.\n\nFor tumorType: \"Plexiform neurofibroma (morphologic abnormality)\". The Target Schema lists \"Plexiform Neurofibroma\" with a capital P and without the parenthetical. The extra text in parentheses is likely a descriptor, so removing that and capitalizing properly should align it with the enum value.\n\nI need to ensure all replacements use the exact terms from the schema, checking for case sensitivity and any extra descriptors. Let me verify each enum list again to confirm the correct terms. Once confirmed, I'll adjust each field accordingly and return the corrected JSON.\n",

The input is \"Neurofibromatosis type 1 with scoliosis\". The Target Schema's diagnosis enum includes \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\". Since \"with scoliosis\" is a specific detail not in the enum, I should remove that to match the broader term exactly.\n\nNext, the assay is \"anti-tag immunocytochemistry\". The Target Schema's assay enum has \"immunocytochemistry\". The \"anti-tag\" part is a specific method detail not listed, so I'll drop that to use the broader term \"immunocytochemistry\".\n\nFor tumorType, the input is \"sessile cutaneous neurofibroma\". The Target Schema's tumorType enum includes \"Cutaneous Neurofibroma\". \"Sessile\" is a descriptor not present in the enum, so removing it gives the correct term. Also, I need to capitalize it to match the enum exactly: \"Cutaneous Neurofibroma\".\n\nI need to ensure all replacements use the exact enum values without any variations.
