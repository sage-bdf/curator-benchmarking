The input data is a JSON string inside the grid_data field. First, I should parse that JSON to get the actual rows array.\n\nSo, the grid_data is a string, so I need to parse it into a JSON object. Once parsed, there's a \"rows\" key which is an array of objects. Each object has an \"id\" and a \"valid\" boolean. My task is to go through each of these rows and check if \"valid\" is false. For each row where valid is false, I increment the count.\n\nLet me check the example input. The grid_data has rows with ids 1 to 4. Rows 2 and 4 have valid: false. So that's two rows. The expected count should be 2.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that I'm correctly parsing the JSON. The grid_data is given as a string, so in a real scenario, I would parse it using JSON.parse() or whatever the equivalent is in the programming language. But since I'm just simulating the thought process, I can assume that after parsing, the rows array is accessible.\n\nSo steps:\n1. Parse the grid_data string into a JSON object.\n2. Access the rows array.\n3. Iterate over each row in the array.\n4. For each row, check if the valid property is false.\n5. Count all such rows.\n\nPotential edge cases: What if a row doesn't have a valid property? But according to the problem statement, the rows have validation status information, so probably all rows have the valid key. But if some rows are missing it, maybe they should be considered invalid? The problem says \"where valid is false\", so only count when valid is explicitly false. If the valid key is missing, it's not counted. But the input example shows all rows have valid, so maybe we can assume that.\n\nAnother case: valid could be a string \"false\" instead of a boolean. But the example uses booleans, so the input data is expected to have boolean values for valid.\n\nSo, in the given input, after parsing, the rows array has four elements. Two of them (id 2 and 4) have valid: false. So the count is 2.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response should be {\"count\": 2}.\n",

The input data is a JSON object with grid_data as a string. First, I need to parse the grid_data string into a JSON object.\n\nSo, the grid_data is a string that contains another JSON object. Parsing that should give me the rows array. Then, I need to loop through each row in the rows array and check if the valid property is false. Each time I find a row where valid is false, I increment a counter.\n\nLet me check the input again. The grid_data has rows with ids 1 to 5. The valid values are true, false, false, true, false. So rows 2, 3, and 5 are invalid. That's three rows. So the count should be 3.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The rows array is:\n\n[\n  {\"id\": 1, \"valid\": true},\n  {\"id\": 2, \"valid\": false},\n  {\"id\": 3, \"valid\": false},\n  {\"id\": 4, \"valid\": true},\n  {\"id\": 5, \"valid\": false}\n]\n\nYes, that's three entries where valid is false. So the count is 3. The answer should be a JSON object with \"count\": 3. I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, with the count as a number. Alright, that's straightforward. No other steps needed. Just parse, iterate, count, and return the result.\n",

The input data is a JSON structure with a grid_data string that contains the rows.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the grid_data. It's a string, so I should convert it into a JSON object. The grid_data has a \"rows\" array, and each row has an \"id\" and a \"valid\" boolean. My task is to go through each row in that array and check if \"valid\" is false. Every time I find a row where valid is false, I increment the count.\n\nLet me look at the example input. The grid_data has rows with ids 1 to 6. Rows 3 and 6 have \"valid\": false. So the count should be 2. The output should be a JSON object with \"count\": 2.\n\nWait, I need to make sure that I'm correctly parsing the grid_data. The input data's grid_data is a string representation of a JSON object. So I need to parse it twice: first, parse the outer JSON, then parse the grid_data string into another JSON object. Then access the rows array.\n\nSo steps:\n1. Parse the input data's grid_data string into a JSON object.\n2. Iterate over each row in the rows array.\n3. For each row, check if the \"valid\" key is false.\n4. Count all such rows.\n5. Return the count in the specified JSON structure.\n\nLet me test this logic with the given example. The rows are 6 in total. Rows 3 and 6 are invalid. So count is 2. That's correct.\n\nI should also handle cases where maybe the \"valid\" key is missing, but according to the problem statement, each row has the \"valid\" key. So no need to handle missing keys here. Just check for valid being false.\n\nAnother edge case: if all rows are valid, count is 0. If none are valid, count is the total number of rows. But in the given example, it's 2.\n\nSo the final answer should be {\"count\": 2}.\n",
