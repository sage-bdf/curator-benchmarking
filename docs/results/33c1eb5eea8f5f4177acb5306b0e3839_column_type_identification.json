The grid_structure is a JSON string, so I should start by converting that into a JSON object to access the columns.\n\nLooking at the columns array, there are three entries: timestamp, event, and severity. Each has a name and a type. The column in question is \"timestamp\". Scanning through the list, the entry with \"name\": \"timestamp\" has a \"type\" specified as \"datetime\". \n\nI need to make sure that \"datetime\" is one of the standard data types mentioned. The user listed examples like \"string\", \"integer\", \"number\", \"date\", \"datetime\", \"boolean\", etc. Since \"datetime\" is explicitly listed, that's the correct type here. There's no ambiguity because the column's type is directly provided in the grid structure. So the answer should be straightforward.\n",

First, I need to parse the input data correctly. The grid_structure is a JSON string, so I should start by converting that into a JSON object to access the columns.\n\nLooking at the columns array, there are three entries: timestamp, event, and severity. Each has a name and a type. The column in question is \"timestamp\". Scanning through the list, the entry with \"name\": \"timestamp\" has a \"type\" specified as \"datetime\". \n\nI need to make sure that \"datetime\" is one of the standard data types mentioned. The user listed examples like \"string\", \"integer\", \"number\", \"date\", \"datetime\", \"boolean\", etc. Since \"datetime\" is explicitly listed, that's the correct type here. There's no ambiguity because the column's type is directly provided in the grid structure. So the answer should be straightforward.\n"
