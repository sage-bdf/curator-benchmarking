My job is to explain the specific issues based on the validation errors and the column values.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input data. The row_data is a JSON string. The row has an email column with the value \"invalid-email\" and a status column set to \"active\". The validation error listed is that the 'email' column must be a valid email address. \n\nSo, the main issue here is the email format. The value \"invalid-email\" doesn't conform to standard email formats because it's missing the @ symbol and a domain part. Even though the status is \"active\", which might be valid, the email's invalidity makes the entire row fail validation. I need to make sure the explanation clearly points out the email column's value and why it's invalid, referencing the specific validation error provided.\n"

The start_date is January 1, 2024, and the end_date is December 31, 2023. Clearly, the end_date is before the start_date. That's a logical inconsistency because an end date should come after the start date. \n\nI need to make sure the explanation references the specific columns and their values. The error message mentions 'end_date' must be after start_date, so I should point out that the end_date (2023-12-31) is earlier than the start_date (2024-01-01). \n\nI should structure the explanation in JSON as specified, with the explanation text clearly stating the problem. Let me check if there are any other possible issues, but the validation error only lists that one. So the explanation should focus on the date order problem between the two columns.\n",
