The user wants me to extract specific column values from a given row in a grid/table structure. The input data includes the row data, selected columns, and a question. My task is to return a JSON object with the selected columns and their corresponding values, maintaining the correct data types.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input data. The row_data is a JSON string, so I should parse it into a JavaScript object. Similarly, the selected_columns is a JSON array string that needs parsing. Let me check the structure of row_data. It has a row_id and a columns object containing the actual data. The columns object has keys \"a\" and \"b\" with values 1 and \"one\" respectively. The selected columns are [\"a\", \"b\"], so I need to extract both.\n\nI need to make sure that the keys in the resulting JSON match the selected columns exactly. The values should be taken from the columns object in row_data. For the first row (row_id 1), the values for \"a\" is 1 (a number) and \"b\" is \"one\" (a string). I should ensure that numbers remain numbers and strings stay as strings, not converting them. Also, if any value is null, it should stay null.\n\nPutting this together, the JSON response should have keys \"a\" and \"b\" with their respective values. Let me double-check that there are no typos in the keys and that the data types are preserved. Yes, 1 is a number, and \"one\" is a string. No other columns are selected, so only these two should be in the output. That should be it.\n",

So, the user wants me to extract specific columns from a given row of data. Let me start by understanding the input.\n\nFirst, the input data includes a row_data field which is a JSON string. It has a row_id and a columns object containing patient_id, diagnosis, and age. The selected_columns are [\"patient_id\", \"diagnosis\"], and the question is asking for the values of these columns in the first row. Wait, but the row_id here is 2. Hmm, maybe the question is a bit misleading, but the input data clearly specifies the row with row_id 2. So I should focus on that row regardless of the question's mention of \"first row\".\n\nNext, I need to parse the row_data and selected_columns from their string representations into actual JSON objects. The row_data is a JSON string, so I'll parse it to get the columns object. Similarly, selected_columns is a JSON array string, so I'll parse that into a list of column names.\n\nOnce parsed, I need to loop through each selected column name and retrieve the corresponding value from the row's columns. For example, patient_id in the columns is \"P001\", and diagnosis is \"NF1\". The age is 25, but since it's not in the selected_columns, I'll ignore it.\n\nI also need to ensure that the data types are maintained. In this case, both patient_id and diagnosis are strings, so they should be returned as strings in the JSON. There are no numbers or nulls here, but if there were, I should keep their types as is.\n\nPutting it all together, the final JSON should have keys as the selected column names and their respective values from the row_data. So the output should be a JSON object with patient_id: \"P001\" and diagnosis: \"NF1\".\n\nLet me double-check that I didn't miss any columns or include extra ones. The selected_columns list has two entries, and both are present in the row_data's columns. Everything looks good. No typos in the column names either.

The selected columns are file_name and file_type. Therefore, the result should include those two keys with their respective values.\n\nI need to make sure that the data types are maintained.

The user wants me to extract specific column values from a given row of data. The input data includes a row with columns and some selected columns. My job is to pick those selected columns and return their values in a JSON format.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input data. The row_data is a JSON string, so I should parse that into a Python dictionary. Similarly, the selected_columns is also a JSON string array. Let me parse both of those. \n\nLooking at the row_data, after parsing, it has a \"row_id\" of 7 and a \"columns\" object with \"experiment_id\" as \"EXP001\", \"replicate\" as 3, and \"condition\" as \"control\". The selected columns are [\"experiment_id\", \"condition\"]. \n\nSo, I need to go into the columns of the row_data and extract the values for each selected column. The keys in the resulting JSON should be the column names, and the values should be the corresponding values from the row. \n\nI should check if all selected columns exist in the row's columns. In this case, both \"experiment_id\" and \"condition\" are present. Their values are \"EXP001\" and \"control\" respectively. \n\nNow, I need to construct a JSON object with these key-value pairs. The data types should be preserved. \"experiment_id\" is a string, so it should stay in quotes. \"condition\" is also a string. There are no numbers or nulls here, but if there were, I'd make sure numbers are not in quotes and null is represented as null.\n\nPutting it all together, the final JSON should look like:\n{\n  \"experiment_id\": \"EXP001\",\n  \"condition\": \"control\"\n}\n\nI need to make sure there are no typos in the keys and that the JSON structure is correct.

The input data includes a row with columns and some selected columns. My job is to pick those selected columns and return their values in a JSON format.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input data. The row_data is a JSON string, so I should parse that into a Python dictionary. Similarly, the selected_columns is also a JSON string array. Let me parse both of those. \n\nLooking at the row_data, after parsing, it has a \"row_id\" of 7 and a \"columns\" object with \"experiment_id\" as \"EXP001\", \"replicate\" as 3, and \"condition\" as \"control\". The selected columns are [\"experiment_id\", \"condition\"]. \n\nSo, I need to go into the columns of the row_data and extract the values for each selected column. The keys in the resulting JSON should be the column names, and the values should be the corresponding values from the row. \n\nI should check if all selected columns exist in the row's columns. In this case, both \"experiment_id\" and \"condition\" are present. Their values are \"EXP001\" and \"control\" respectively. \n\nNow, I need to construct a JSON object with these key-value pairs. The data types should be preserved. \"experiment_id\" is a string, so it should stay in quotes. \"condition\" is also a string. There are no numbers or nulls here, but if there were, I'd make sure numbers are not in quotes and null is represented as null.\n\nPutting it all together, the final JSON should look like:\n{\n  \"experiment_id\": \"EXP001\",\n  \"condition\": \"control\"\n}\n\nI need to make sure there are no typos in the keys and that the JSON structure is correct. Also, ensure that the order of the selected columns is maintained as per the list, but since JSON objects are unordered, the order might not matter, but the keys should exactly match the selected column names.\n"

The user wants me to extract specific columns from a given row of data. Let me start by understanding the input.\n\nFirst, the input data includes a row_data object which is a JSON string.

So the values should be \"A\", \"success\", and 85 respectively.\n\nI need to make sure that the data types are preserved. The score is a number, so it should stay as 85, not a string. The other values are strings. The JSON structure should have keys as the selected column names and their corresponding values. Let me double-check that I'm not missing any columns or including extra ones. The selected_columns list has three entries, and the output should have exactly those three keys. Also, the row_id is 8, but the question mentions the first row. However, since the input specifies row_data with row_id 8, I should use that data regardless of the row_id. The user might have a typo in the question, but the task is to extract from the given row_data.\n\nSo the final JSON should be treatment: \"A\", outcome: \"success\", score: 85.

So I need to map each selected column to its corresponding value. \n\nNow, checking the data types. The location is a string, temperature is a float (22.5), humidity is 45.0 which is also a float. The output JSON should maintain these data types. So numbers shouldn't be quoted as strings.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON response should have keys as the selected column names and their respective values from the row_data. Let me structure that. Make sure the JSON is valid and the keys are in the order listed in selected_columns, though JSON doesn't require order. But the example shows the same order, so maybe follow that.\n\nDouble-checking for any possible errors. Are all selected columns present? Yes. Are the data types correct? Yes. No null values here. Alright, that should be it.\n"
