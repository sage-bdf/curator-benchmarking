The user wants me to broaden narrow synonyms in the input data using the exact terms from the Target Schema.\n\nFirst, looking at the diagnosis field. The input is \"Neurofibromatosis type 1 microdeletion syndrome\". The Target Schema's diagnosis enum includes \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\". Since \"microdeletion syndrome\" is a specific subtype, the broader term here would be \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\". So I'll replace that.\n\nNext, the assay is \"clinical whole-exome sequencing\". The Target Schema's assay enum has \"whole exome sequencing\". The input uses \"clinical\" and hyphenates \"whole-exome\", but the correct term is \"whole exome sequencing\" without hyphen and without \"clinical\". So I'll change it to \"whole exome sequencing\".\n\nFor tumorType, the input is \"Plexiform neurofibroma (morphologic abnormality)\". The Target Schema's tumorType enum lists \"Plexiform Neurofibroma\". The input has lowercase and a parenthetical, which should be removed. So the correct term is \"Plexiform Neurofibroma\".\n\nI need to ensure all replacements use the exact enum values. No variations allowed. Let me double-check each field against the schema. Diagnosis: correct. Assay: yes, \"whole exome sequencing\" is in the enum. TumorType: \"Plexiform Neurofibroma\" is there. Looks good.

The input is \"neurofibromatosis, peripheral type\". The Target Schema's enum for diagnosis includes \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\". Since \"peripheral type\" might be a specific reference to type 1, which is a common form, I should map it to \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\". The other options like \"Schwannomatosis\" or \"NF2-related\" don't fit here. So \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\" is the correct replacement.\n\nNext, the \"assay\" field has \"wide bore MRI\". The Target Schema's assay enum includes \"conventional MRI\". \"Wide bore\" refers to the physical size of the MRI machine, but the general method is still conventional MRI. There's no specific \"wide bore\" option, so \"conventional MRI\" is the appropriate broader term.\n\nFor \"tumorType\", the input is \"no clear diagnosis\". The Target Schema's tumorType enum has \"Unknown\". Since \"no clear diagnosis\" implies that the tumor type couldn't be determined, \"Unknown\" is the correct replacement here. Checking the enum list confirms that \"Unknown\" is an available option.\n\nI need to ensure that all replacements exactly match the Target Schema's enums. No variations or synonyms should be used. Each field is checked against the provided lists, and the closest matching broader term is selected. The output JSON should maintain the same structure as the input, only replacing the values as specified.\n",
