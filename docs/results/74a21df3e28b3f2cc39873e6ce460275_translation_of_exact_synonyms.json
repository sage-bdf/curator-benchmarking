So we can map missing synonyms to Unknown. But we want \"near exact synonyms\" mapping. The user said we replace synonyms with standard, preferred equivalents. But the code is not a synonym; it's an identifier. We might map to \"Unknown\" until context.\n\nMaybe we could call it \"Sporadic Schwannoma\" as that is a commonly used term for a singular tumor. But ORPHA:636 may refer to \"Schwannoma\". But \"Schwannoma\" not in list. The list includes \"Schwannomatosis\" (multiple tumors) and \"Sporadic Schwannoma\" (single). So we choose Sporadic Schwannoma.\n\nAssay: \"WGS\" stands for whole genome sequencing. In schema, enumeration includes \"whole genome sequencing\". Yes \"whole genome sequencing\" is listed.

In the schema, enum includes \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\". The input uses \"Neurofibromatosis-1\". Should be replaced with \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\", presumably. Confirm if any hyphen vs type. In enum \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\". So replace.\n\n- \"assay\": \"magnetic resonance imaging\". In enum, we have \"magnetic resonance imaging\" options: \"Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo MRI\", \"Conventional MRI\", \"Structural MRI\" etc. But the actual enum list includes many variants, but also includes \"magnetic resonance imaging\"?? Let's scroll. The list includes \"Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo MRI\" under assay, as a variant. Also \"functional MRI\"; but I don't see a generic \"magnetic resonance imaging\" spelled exactly. There is \"magnetic resonance imaging\" maybe not? The list includes \"magnetic resonance imaging\" only as \"magnetic resonance imaging\" maybe present? Let's re-check the list at the top for assay: I see options such as \"2D AlamarBlue absorbance\", ... \"magnetic resonance imaging\" seems not present. The list includes \"Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo MRI\", \"Conventional MRI\", \"Structural MRI\"... Under assay list, I don't see \"magnetic resonance imaging\" exactly. Actually I see \"magnetic resonance imaging\" maybe as \"magnetic resonance imaging\"? Let's search: I recall \"magnetic resonance imaging\" was not included; but I see \"magnetic resonance imaging\" maybe not. Let's double-check: There is \"magnetic resonance imaging\" in the enumerated values for assay? I see at  \"MIB/MS\", \"Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo MRI\", \"Matrigel-based tumorigenesis assay\", \"Migration Assay\", etc. There is no generic \"magnetic resonance imaging\". Might need to use one of the specific MRI assays. The input says \"magnetic resonance imaging\". We need to use a controlled value from the enum. The most general could be \"Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo MRI\" or \"Structural MRI\" or \"Conventional MRI\". But which is standard? The schema includes \"magnetic resonance imaging\" as part of the list? Let me scan again: Under assay list: after \"RBPTe\", \"microarray\" etc. Actually I can't recall all. Let's copy some portion: The list starts with \"2D AlamarBlue absorbance\", ... long list, eventually includes \"Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo MRI\", but no generic \"magnetic resonance imaging\". Also in the schema we have assay terms \"Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo MRI\" but not \"magnetic resonance imaging\". So we'd need to translate synonyms to match one of the enum values. The input \"magnetic resonance imaging\" might be translated to \"Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo MRI\" or \"Structural MRI\". But which is more appropriate? I'd lean to \"Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo MRI\" maybe as a type of MRI. The simplest mapping is \"magnetic resonance imaging\" -> \"Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo MRI\" maybe not typical. Maybe we should use \"Conventional MRI\" if that is generic MRI. But the schema includes \"Conventional MRI\". That is generic MRI. So I'd translate to \"Conventional MRI\".\n\nBut consider that \"magnetic resonance imaging\" synonyms might map to \"magnetic resonance imaging\" multiple specialized terms. The generic is \"magnetic resonance imaging\", and the controlled terms sometimes include \"Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo MRI\" which is just one specific sequence. I'd choose \"Conventional MRI\" as a generic MRI variant.\n\nAlternatively, there is also \"magnetic resonance imaging\" maybe not. Let's search the list: I see \"Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo MRI\" but none else. There's \"structural MRI\". \"spectroscopy\". \"freehand\". So I'd output \"Conventional MRI\".\n\n- \"tumorType\": \"not determined\". In enum, there's a value \"Not Applicable\" and also \"Unknown\" and \"tumor\" etc. \"not determined\" should match \"Not Applicable\" maybe? Or \"Unknown\". The most similar is \"Not Applicable\" but that implies data not applicable. \"not determined\" is usually \"Unknown\". I think we map to \"Unknown\".\n\nThus propose:\n\n{\n  \"diagnosis\": \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\",\n  \"assay\": \"Conventional MRI\",\n  \"tumorType\": \"Unknown\"\n}\n\nBut we must check that \"Conventional MRI\" is indeed in the enum list. I saw earlier \"Conventional MRI\" in layout of assay. Let's re-check: In the long list, yes \"Conventional MRI\" appears. Good.\n\nAlso check that \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\" is in diagnosis list. Yes.\n\nThus output as JSON maintaining same structure.</reasoning>```json\n{\n  \"diagnosis\": \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\",\n  \"assay\": \"Conventional MRI\",\n  \"tumorType\": \"Unknown\"\n}\n```\n",

In the schema, enum includes \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\". The input uses \"Neurofibromatosis-1\". Should be replaced with \"Neurofibromatosis type 1\", presumably. Confirm if any hyphen vs type.

In enum, we have \"magnetic resonance imaging\" options: \"Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo MRI\", \"Conventional MRI\", \"Structural MRI\" etc. But the actual enum list includes many variants, but also includes \"magnetic resonance imaging\"?? Let's scroll. The list includes \"Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo MRI\" under assay, as a variant. Also \"functional MRI\"; but I don't see a generic \"magnetic resonance imaging\" spelled exactly. There is \"magnetic resonance imaging\" maybe not? The list includes \"magnetic resonance imaging\" only as \"magnetic resonance imaging\" maybe present? Let's re-check the list at the top for assay: I see options such as \"2D AlamarBlue absorbance\", ... \"magnetic resonance imaging\" seems not present. The list includes \"Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo MRI\", \"Conventional MRI\", \"Structural MRI\"... Under assay list, I don't see \"magnetic resonance imaging\" exactly. Actually I see \"magnetic resonance imaging\" maybe as \"magnetic resonance imaging\"? Let's search: I recall \"magnetic resonance imaging\" was not included; but I see \"magnetic resonance imaging\" maybe not. Let's double-check: There is \"magnetic resonance imaging\" in the enumerated values for assay? I see at  \"MIB/MS\", \"Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo MRI\", \"Matrigel-based tumorigenesis assay\", \"Migration Assay\", etc. There is no generic \"magnetic resonance imaging\". Might need to use one of the specific MRI assays. The input says \"magnetic resonance imaging\". We need to use a controlled value from the enum. The most general could be \"Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo MRI\" or \"Structural MRI\" or \"Conventional MRI\". But which is standard? The schema includes \"magnetic resonance imaging\" as part of the list? Let me scan again: Under assay list: after \"RBPTe\", \"microarray\" etc. Actually I can't recall all.
