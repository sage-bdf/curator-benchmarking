Let's say there's one access requirement with ID 123456. \n\nNext, I need to call GET /accessRequirement/123456/acl to get the ACL for that requirement. The response here would include the AccessControlList, which shows who has permissions. Suppose the ACL has an ID of 789 and the \"managedBy\" field lists principal IDs like 1111 and 2222, or team names like \"Data Curators Team\". The permissions might be [\"REVIEW_ACCESS\", \"MODERATE\", \"CHANGE_PERMISSIONS\"].\n\nNow, summarizing this: the dataset has access requirements managed by those principals or teams. Researchers need to contact them for access. The dataUseSummary should explain that they should reach out to the specified teams, perhaps via Synapse messages or contact info provided, and that access requests are reviewed by these managers.\n\nI need to structure the JSON response with hasAccessRequirements as true, include each requirement's details in aclSummary, and a clear dataUseSummary.

For ar456, maybe it's managed by Principal ID 8910 (an individual) with REVIEW_SUBMISSIONS and VIEW.\n\nNow, summarizing this: the dataset has access requirements managed by two entities. The Data Governance Team and a specific principal. Researchers need to contact these managers to request access. The Data Governance Team handles most aspects, while the principal might be a specific data custodian. \n\nIn the dataUseSummary, I should explain that researchers must submit access requests through Synapse, which will be reviewed by these managers. Contact info might be via Synapse messages or team emails. This means researchers need to ensure they meet the requirements before applying and that response times may vary based on the managers' processes.\n\nI need to structure the JSON response with hasAccessRequirements as true, list each requirement's ACL details, and provide a clear summary for data users.\n"

Let's say there are two access requirements: ar123 and ar456. \n\nNext, for each of these requirement IDs, I need to call GET /accessRequirement/{requirementId}/acl. For ar123, the endpoint would be .../accessRequirement/ar123/acl. The response might give an ACL with an ID like acl789, managed by a team named \"Data Governance Team\" with principal IDs 12345 and 67890. The permissions could be [\"REVIEW_ACCESS\", \"CHANGE_PERMISSIONS\"].\n\nThen for ar456, the ACL might be acl101, managed by principal ID 54321 (maybe an individual), with permissions [\"REVIEW_ACCESS\"].\n\nNow, summarizing the managedBy fields. For ar123, it's a team and some principals. For ar456, an individual. The dataUseSummary needs to explain that researchers should contact these teams or individuals, perhaps through Synapse messages or emails if available. Mention that having specific teams managing access means there's a structured process, and researchers need to submit requests which are reviewed by these managers.\n\nWait, but how do I get contact info? The ACL might not include emails, so the summary should advise contacting them via Synapse. Also, need to check if the permissions include REVIEW_ACCESS, which indicates they can approve requests.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON response should list each requirement with their ACL details, and the dataUseSummary should guide researchers on whom to contact and the implications for data access.\n",
